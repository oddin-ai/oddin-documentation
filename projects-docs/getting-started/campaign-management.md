# Managing Campaigns

The **Campaigns** table in Oddin provides an overview of all your campaigns, including key details such as campaign type and status. Here, you can easily monitor and manage the state of each campaign:

- **Campaign Status**: You’ll see the current state of each campaign, such as Enabled, Deactivated, or Disabled. This allows you to quickly assess which campaigns are active and which ones need adjustments.

To make changes to an existing campaign, simply click on the campaign name in the table. This will open an editable form, similar to the campaign creation form, where you can adjust campaign details as needed.

- **Previewing Campaigns**: Once you’re in the edit form, you can click the “Preview” button in the Bottom left corner of the campaigns page to see exactly how your campaign will appear in your chosen channels before finalizing any updates.

## Viewing Campaign Reports

The _Reports_ page in Oddin’s dashboard provides an overview of your campaign performance, displaying key metrics such as Impressions and Clicks. To access detailed performance insights, follow these steps:

- **Set the Date Range**: Use the input box to select a specific date or range for which you want to view campaign performance data.
- **Customize Your Report View**: Choose to view your report organized by Campaign to see performance metrics for each individual campaign, or by Date to monitor activity over time.
