### **Platform Basics**

#### What is Oddin?

Oddin is a self-serve advertising platform designed specifically for the crypto space. It provides advertisers with direct, automated access to our vetted network of Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) on Telegram and other social platforms.

Instead of spending weeks on manual outreach and negotiations, you can use Oddin to discover relevant channels, launch performance-based campaigns (CPC), and track results in a transparent dashboard.

#### What is KOL Crypto Marketing?

KOL Crypto Marketing is a strategy that leverages the trust and reach of Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs)—influential figures with dedicated communities on platforms like Telegram. Unlike traditional advertising, KOL marketing focuses on native content where the influencer integrates your project's message authentically to their audience.

The challenge has always been finding and verifying legitimate KOLs. Platforms like Oddin solve this by creating a transparent marketplace, removing the risk of fraud and streamlining the entire process from discovery to payment.

#### How does Oddin work for Advertisers?

Our platform streamlines the entire advertising process, combining powerful technology with expert guidance to ensure your campaign connects with the right audience. Here is the workflow:

1.  **Campaign Strategy & Onboarding:** It starts with your goals. After signing up, you define your target audience, campaign objectives, and budget. Our team works with you to refine this strategy, ensuring it's positioned for success from day one.
2.  **Curated KOL Matching:** This is where our expertise comes in. Instead of you spending hours searching for influencers, our team uses our **private, internal network of fully vetted KOLs** to propose a shortlist of channels that are a perfect match for your specific goals. You get access to top-tier, pre-verified talent without the guesswork.
3.  **Launch & Monitor:** Once you approve the recommended KOLs, we handle the launch. Your campaign goes live, and you can track its performance in real-time through your advertiser dashboard. With our performance-based CPC (Cost Per Click) model, you have full transparency and only pay for tangible results.

### **Trust, Safety & Performance**

#### How does Oddin ensure KOL quality and campaign safety?

We've built our platform on a foundation of trust and safety, employing a multi-layered approach:

- **Rigorous KOL Vetting:** Every KOL applying to oddin undergoes a review process where we check their channel history, engagement patterns, and community feedback to filter out bots and low-quality channels.
- **Automated Ad Screening:** All submitted ad creatives are automatically scanned for malicious links and prohibited content to ensure compliance with our platform policies and protect our KOL network.
- **Transparent Performance Data:** Our CPC model and real-time dashboard ensure you only pay for real clicks and can monitor performance transparently, eliminating concerns about fake engagement.

#### How is ad performance measured?

Performance is measured in your real-time advertiser dashboard, focusing on clear, actionable metrics. You can track:

- **Impressions:** The number of times your ad was viewed.
- **Clicks:** The number of users who clicked on your ad.
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** The percentage of viewers who clicked your ad (`Clicks ÷ Impressions`).
- **Cost Per Click (CPC):** The effective cost of each click.
- **Total Spend:** Your campaign budget consumption to date.

You can also generate and export reports for deeper analysis.

#### How can I improve the performance of my ads on Oddin?

Improving campaign performance involves optimizing several key areas. Based on data from our top-performing campaigns, we recommend focusing on:

1.  **Compelling Creatives:** Ensure your ad copy is clear, concise, and has a strong Call-to-Action (CTA). A/B test different headlines and images to see what resonates most with your target audience.
2.  **Precise KOL Selection:** Use Oddins filters to select KOLs whose audience demographics and interests closely align with your project. A perfect audience match is the single biggest factor for success.
3.  **Optimized Landing Pages:** Make sure the URL you are advertising leads to a fast, mobile-friendly, and relevant landing page. A user who clicks should immediately understand what to do next.
