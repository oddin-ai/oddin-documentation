## Tracking Your Earnings

In Oddin’s dashboard, you can easily keep track of your earnings from ad campaigns. There are two main places to view your earnings:

1. **Main Dashboard Page**
   On the main page of the dashboard, you’ll find a quick summary of your earnings, clicks, and impressions. You can use the date selector to toggle between today’s performance and a monthly overview, giving you an at-a-glance view of your latest activity and rewards.

2. **Reports Page**
   For a deeper look at your earnings, head to the Reports page. Here, you’ll find detailed breakdowns of your performance metrics, allowing you to see trends over time and review specific campaign statistics. This page provides insights into your total impressions, clicks, and cumulative earnings—perfect for understanding which campaigns are performing best.
