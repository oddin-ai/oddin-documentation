# Suggest Campaigns

Oddin allows advertisers to submit campaigns directly to KOLs through a simple self-service process. This feature makes it easy to propose targeted campaigns tailored to specific KOL channels. Follow these steps to get started:

### Access the Suggest Campaign Link

Click on the link provided by the KOL or publisher. This will take you to a dedicated sign-up screen.

### Complete Sign-Up

If you don’t already have an Oddin account, fill in the required details on the sign-up screen to create one. Once you’ve completed the sign-up process, you’ll be redirected to the campaign submission form.

### Fill Out the Campaign Submission Form

The form is divided into three parts:

- **Add Extra Contact Details**: Provide any additional contact information to ensure clear communication with the KOL.
- **Choose a KOL Channel**: Select the KOL’s channel where you’d like your campaign or post to appear.
- **Enter Post Details**: Enter the content details for your post, including the ad text, link (if applicable), and any required instructions. Upload the creative materials (e.g., images or videos) for the campaign and submit it for approval.
