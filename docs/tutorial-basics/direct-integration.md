# Direct integration

If the site owner wishes, oddin tags can be implemented directly in the html code of the site’s pages. Either in the `<head>` section, or at the end of the document before the `</body>` closing html tag.

This method implementation details are subject for partner site operator, and wont’ be described in this document.

If a referral spot should be rendered in the page, this `<div>` element should be added in the relevant place on the page.

## Example page element

```js title="tag element"
<div id='oddin-tag' style='width: 0; height: 0;'></div>
```
