# Requirements

Partners wishing to work with oddin’s user acquisition hub can do so after implementing oddin’s agreed JavaScript tag on their sites and dApps. The tag can be implemented in three ways:

- Directly on the website/dApp pages
- Using a tag manager
- Using DFP
- With Next.js projects

In any of the above method, the partner needs to be sure that 3rd party cookies are enabled in the relevant sites.
To take full advantage of oddin’s user acquisition hub, partners need to implement the tags according to the tag ids from the oddin’s team, or from the oddin dashboard.
