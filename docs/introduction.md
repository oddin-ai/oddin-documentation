# Introduction

The digital advertising industry faces numerous challenges, it starts with the rise of the content creators on social media and the decline of the mainstream media. Micro-influencers and nano-influencers interact with their audiences in a much more personal way. The problems of the main content websites include a lack of transparency around ad placements and the tracking of user data. Oddin has developed a permissionless platform that brings together the new publishers on social media, advertisers, and third-party targeting services to address these issues. By leveraging technologies such as blockchain, homomorphic computation, and artificial intelligence, Oddin provides a transparent, secure, and efficient platform for publishers and advertisers to place their ads and for users to control their own data.

The traditional digital advertising model is hindered by intermediaries, such as ad networks, exchanges, and agencies, marketplaces, which increase complexity and costs. These intermediaries also limit advertisers' control over ad placement and raise concerns about brand safety and data privacy. Additionally, ad fraud remains a persistent issue, wasting ad expenditure and eroding trust within the advertising ecosystem.

Because of all the problems mentioned, more advertisers are moving to social media as a solution. Social media advertising presents several challenges for advertisers and content creators. The complex algorithms of social media platforms can limit ads' reach, and the content's authenticity and credibility are often questioned. Additionally, the lack of transparency in social media advertising makes it challenging for advertisers to accurately measure their campaigns' impact. Finally, fake followers, likes, and comments on social media can distort the true value of advertising on these platforms.

Oddin's decentralized approach eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing transaction costs and improving user experience. Advertisers can ensure their ads are displayed on legitimate platforms and reach their target audience, while publishers have control over their data and can decide how it is utilized in advertising. Furthermore, the Oddin ecosystem welcomes collaboration with third-party service providers, allowing them to offer innovative solutions and services. This opens up opportunities for businesses to provide ad-relevant services, such as flagging bad ads or recommending ad placements. By connecting multiple service providers to the network, Oddin fosters innovation and creates a robust ecosystem that benefits all participants.

In this document, we will delve into the challenges faced by the traditional digital advertising industry, by publishers from small content creators on social media to large mainstream media, and by brands themselves. We will explore the decentralized advertising ecosystem solution offered by Oddin, highlighting its key features and benefits. Additionally, we will discuss the various actors and components within the ecosystem, as well as the opportunities and use cases that emerge from this decentralized approach.

Oddin aims to transform the digital advertising industry, providing transparency, security, and efficiency for advertisers, publishers, and users alike.
